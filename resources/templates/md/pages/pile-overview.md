## Laboratory Maniac Piles

Rather than the stormcount these piles list the amount they would require when all Gitaxian Probes are paid for using life.

### Basic piles:
```
GP in hand:
-> IU, SDT, LED, GP, LM              BBB+1UU               4 life

SDT in play:

## Doomsday-Time Spiral Piles

For these piles you sometimes need some cards in hand or post-Doomsday graveyard, to prevent decking yourself when casting TS. Remember that Doomsday is always in your post-Doomsday graveyard and that the Burning Wish used to wish for Time Spiral, as well as Time Spiral are exiled. Mana cost in square brackets [ ] can be paid using your lands after they were untapped by Time Spiral.

## Doomsday-Time Spiral-Doomsday Piles

Mana cost in square brackets [ ] can be paid using your lands after they were untapped by Time Spiral.

```
SDT in play + 1 card:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW              BBB+3UU+[BBB+1]       17 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW

SDT in play + LED:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW              BBB+2+[BBB+1]         19 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW

-> IU, DR, LED, BW, BW               BBB+1B+[U/R]+[1B]     19 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW
```


## double-Doomsday double-Chain of Vapor piles

storm counts assume that any LEDs that can bounced and replayed without increasing the mana cost are bounced and replayed. Costs written as [x/y] means you have to pay either. For the second doomsday pile you can choose from:

```
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, X               +0                    +0 Storm
-> IU, LED, CoV, LED, BW             +1U                   +4 Storm
-> IU, LED, CoV, LED, ToA            +U                    +2 Storm
```
mana costs and storm counts listed here assume the top alternative.

```
SDT in play + CoV:
-> LED, IU, LED, DD, BW              BBB+[1UU/BBB]+1U (8)  13 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, X

SDT in play + LED:
-> IU, CoV, LED, DD, BW              BBB+[1UU/BBB]+1U (8)  15 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, X

IU + LED:
-> SDT, CoV, LED, DD, BW             BBB+1UU+1U (8)        15 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, X

GP + 2x LED:
-> IU, SDT, CoV, DD, BW              BBB+[1UU/BBB]+U (7)   14 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, X

GP + LED + BW:
-> IU, SDT, CoV, LED, DD             BBB+[1UU/BBB]+1U (8)  16 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, X
```


## Pass the turn Piles using Time Spiral

For these piles you sometimes need some cards in hand or post-Doomsday graveyard, to prevent decking yourself when casting TS. Remember that Doomsday is always in your post-Doomsday graveyard and that the Burning Wish used to wish for Time Spiral, as well as Time Spiral are exiled.

```
2 cards in hand or graveyard:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW              1UUR    (4)   9 Storm

LED in play + 1 card:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, BW              UU    (2)     10 Storm

IU in hand + 1 card:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, BW             UU    (2)     11 Storm
```

Essentially you want IU + 2 LEDs + 2 BWs as 5 cards, so you may have any of these in hand or post-DD graveyard as long as you can resolve Burning Wish->Time Spiral.

### Lab Man pass the turn with protection

Different piles are listed for different purposes. Some piles play around a single counterspell or any single card in hand.
Some cheaper variants play around removal on Lab Man.
These piles are quite heavy on life, especially after passing the turn with Doomsday.
In these piles I use Silence, this can obviously be replaced with discard if you prefer.

```
GP in hand:
-> Silence, IU, LP, GP, LM           W+2UU        4 life
-> LED, IU, Silence, GP, LM          W+2          4 life

LED:
-> SDT, IU, Silence, GP, LM          W+4          2 life
-> GP, IU, Silence, GP, LM           W+2          4 life

SDT in play:
-> Silence, IU, LED, GP, LM          W+1UU        2 life
-> LED, IU, Silence, GP, LM          W+2          2 life
```
