All the puzzles documented here should be solvable using the
information and techniques listed throughout chapter one, two and three: 
"The Fundamentals", "Supplementary Techniques" and "Limitations".

Each puzzle may have multiple answers so if you find a solution,
have a go at seeing if you can identify an alternative method.

Some puzzles are tiered. Each tier will have increased restrictions
on what resources are / are not available. You might find early on 
the pile or play line that beats every tier already. If this is the 
case then well done, but don't forget to consider alternatives for
any of the tiers.

Unless otherwise explicitly stated, each puzzle will have at least one 
clear solution or answer so if you cannot find the line, don't give up!
We're not trying to trick you.

Unless explicitly stated you do have a land drop available to you.
