###Bio  
A UB obsessed Doomsday player from Bristol, UK. I enjoy paying my life into oblivion, having opponents have to judge call to understand my cards and collecting Gitaxian Probes. I have no notable success to my name but I am very good at reviewing the play of others and coming up with ubiquitous BS in terms of deckbuilding. My main goals are just trying to get better with my current aim being to day 2 a GP.

I'm a cat person.
