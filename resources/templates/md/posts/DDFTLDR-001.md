 ## Episode 0: Where TacoHell goes on a crazy adventure

![Deck choice graph]()

First, let’s start with my life story.

I started playing Magic probably a lot like you did--a kid at his kitchen table (s/o to Thorn Elemental)
--then I stopped playing, probably a lot like you did. I got back into the game around the time Theros
dropped. I played exactly 1 FNM, and decided that Standard was lame.  Austin had a pretty active Legacy
community at the time, and I found out combo decks were a thing, so I sold off my Polukranoses and
never looked back.

Well, first I played Burn, then Nic Fit, then I never looked back.

During my entire legacy “career,” Doomsday has been a name to throw around as a joke.  Combo-curious
newbs are told to play it only if you “are a masochist” or “like memorizing spreadsheets.”  After the
apparent death and rebirth of Doomsday between April and June of 2017, I texted an ANT enthusiast friend 
of mine that I was starting to goldfish DDFT.  He said “Man, don’t.”

I was hooked.  

So I think the first question to answer in a series like this is:  

### Who am I?

My name is Quin.  
I’m a pretty mediocre storm player.  
I’m passable at math, but nowhere near the Rainman-level super-genius that people make it sound
like you need to be to play DDFT.  
I have a really itchy trigger finger.  
My favorite deck is probably Belcher or Tin Fins.  

### Why am I doing this to myself?

I originally had a long answer typed out, but here’s the (ddf)tl;dr:
Life is short.  Legacy (for me) is about doing weird and awesome stuff.  Doomsday is one of the
weirder, more awesome things that are legal in the format. It just makes sense to me.
Basically everybody I asked told me not to play Doomsday.  

So, here we are...

### Where is this series going?  

Thankfully, there’s a lot of Doomsday Content out there (thanks to an extremely enthusiastic and 
dedicated community).  As I’ve looked through this content, it doesn’t feel like there is anything
that follows someone as they actively learn the deck.  So, my goal is to do just that: learn DDFT,
and publically reflect on the lessons I’m learning, so we can learn this together.

To reach this goal, I’ve got a few things I’m planning to do:  
- Stream and/or Record MTGO Leagues  
My schedule is going to be pretty hectic for the foreseeable future, which means I’ll be missing almost
all of my local paper events.  Because of that, I’m looking to get in as many reps as I can online.
I can’t promise that these will be on a regular schedule, but I’d like to make them available, both
to have a record of improvement, but also to get feedback on play from the community.
- Track Data
I think we’ve all seen that [Bryant Cook’s spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C9N0raG3_o8d4SL6_KjYt6lcuFzY5YxhAKAjIEG_L6M/edit#gid=1782415521) has been a really great
tool for the storm community. Doishy started a [similar project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14hIVFCCxK6v6PHzj_7opfigFWVGV73kv59OdeN-J95I/edit#gid=0) for the Doomsday cabal,
and I’m really excited to contribute my match results to this, as well as tracking my own
individual results to get a clearer idea of how I’m doing relative to the rest of our community.
- Reflect
A big part of what I want to do with this series is reflect on patterns I notice in playing the deck. 
DDFT has so many subtleties to it (cantripping, fetching, mulligans, to name a few), and I want to 
ponder these questions as my understanding of the deck evolves, but also elicit feedback from other,
more experienced DDFT pilots to compare notes.  I’m not quite sure what format this would take yet
(puzzles, something along the lines of the Doomsday by Committee articles, etc).

### Conclusion  

Having just read Doishy’s article on [DDFT in 2017](https://ddft.wiki/posts-output/DD_2017/), it seems
like a good idea to confront the biggest hole people try to poke in the argument to play Doomsday:
```
Why not play ANT or TES?  
```
I’m not disputing that there are other decks that have better or more consistent finishes, and I 
have enormous respect for the Storm pilots who have gotten the archetype to where it is today.  
But, I feel like that argument misses the point; that’s pretty much the whole allure of the DDFT.
Doomsday is difficult and mysterious.  
Doomsday makes a statement.  
A lot of people don’t even know that Doomsday is still a thing.  

I hope you guys (and gals) are as ready for the judge calls as I am.


Thanks for reading my Doomsday Manifesto! Next time I’ll see you all for my baptism by MTGO 5-round League.  


### TL;DR:  Was told not to play Doomsday.  Decided to play Doomsday.



## EPISODE 1:  Before Picture

![Decklist Picture]()

Last time on DDFTL:DR - Doomsday is hard, but that’s pretty much what makes it worth doing.

Let’s get to the point:  I think it makes sense to start with a snapshot of where I am, so as
to better gauge my (eventual) progress.   

### My Doomsday experience up to this point: 
- 2 Local paper events (one immortalized [here](http://teamstormboards.proboards.com/thread/613/first-paper-event-ddft-beer))  
- A bunch of random matches in the Tournament Practice room on MtGO (most of these were with
the old UBrw list, with Monastery Mentor out of the sideboard)

So, obviously, that’s not very many reps.  Especially for a deck with a steep learning curve
and a lot of little subtleties.  But that’s also more or less the point of this series.

### Pre-game thoughts:
I feel pretty confident with the basic [Tendrils](http://ddft.wiki/pages-output/ch1/basics/) 
and [Lab Man](http://ddft.wiki/pages-output/ch1/laboratory-maniac/) Piles.  
I understand, in theory, how [Brainstorm](http://ddft.wiki/pages-output/ch1/brainstorm/) and 
[Conjurer’s Bauble](http://ddft.wiki/pages-output/ch2/cb-piles/) piles work, but I’m worried
I might miss them in a game.  
There’s some serious tension with the cantrips. It’s a really hard choice to either
try to proactively assemble the combo, or wait to use them as part of the combo. The list certainly
has enough cantrips to do both, but awkward draws put increasing pressure on the one or two cantrips in hand.
Burning wish for answers feels surprisingly good, but usually a little clunky.  
Some of the do-nothing cards that Doomsday forces you to play feel really awkward if 
you draw them before the combo (Laboratory Maniac especially).  
Finally, the deck pretty regularly feels about a turn too slow in a lot of matchups. I want to examine this point further, because it seems possible/likely that this is something about the way I’m playing (probably cantrip or mulligan decisions)

The League:

### Round 1:  LED Dredge (2-1)  
[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1rhbKF0gWI&list=PLPsGulnfHUXndjdzkvIZH6ChbyUlEwkdX)  

Dredge is a matchup I played in my first paper event with Doomsday, and he tore me a new one
with all of those Cabal Therapies they can power out.  It seemed like the best plan here was 
to commit LEDs, etc to the board, and to try and jam a fast pile which couldn’t be discarded to
death.

Game 1:  Dredge takes me by surprise.  He doesn’t have an explosive start, and I jam a
[pass-the-turn pile](http://ddft.wiki/pages-output/ch1/pass-the-turn) on turn 1, Lab Man
gets there Turn 2.

Game 2: I keep a hand that can combo quickly, and then he discards my Doomsday and I never
recover and die to a bajillion Narcomoeba attacks.  This game draaaaains my clock, so I 
scoop maybe a little too early to save as much of that as I can for game 3.

Game 3:  I’m able to combo quickly with Lab Man and end the game with barely any time left on the clock. Phew.  

![MTGO Win Screenshot]()

In:  
2 Echoing Truth (to wrath the Zombie horde)   
Out:  
2 Conjurer’s Bauble (they seem slow--maybe this was wrong though, since they’re my only 
non-blue cantrip, which could be relevant if he Dread Returns an Iona.)

Overall, I feel pretty good about these games, and I think a lot of the success here came down
to having pretty good hands.  My goal for the league was to win a match, and we got there!

### Round 2: RIP/Helm (0-2)
[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXnd1OTbrgE&list=PLPsGulnfHUXndjdzkvIZH6ChbyUlEwkdX&index=2)

Game 1: I keep sort of a sketchy hand, looking back.  I put my opponent on miracles and opt
for a pretty conservative opener to try and hide the fact that I’m on DDFT.  I decide to commit
all of my artifacts to the board to get them resolved while I can.  Turns out he’s on RIP/Helm
combo and has a bunch of countermagic.  I draw a ton of mana and he kills me (but with so much mana),

Game 2: I play out a Xantid Swarm who decides to take up a career in farming on my opponent’s first turn.
He gets a fast RIP (Rest in Peace) in play, and stops some attempts to discard him.  I run into a weird
situation where I have Burning Wish, Act on Impulse, and Dark Ritual in hand, and a Conjurer’s Bauble and
an LED in play with a Volcanice Island and 2 Underground Seas.  It seems like I can wish for a Doomsday
and go off, but the LED activation would get my Act exiled by the RIP.  I decide to wait a turn to see
if I can hit a brainstorm to make a brainstorm pile to save the day.  I end up going for it and get 
countered out.  Womp womp. (Spoilers: it doesn’t work)

In:  
2 Xantid Swarm (seems solid vs slower decks playing permission)
1 Tropical Island (casting Xantid Swarm seems good)
Out:  
2 Conjurer’s Bauble (redundant copies are meh, and it’s on the slower end of my cantrips)  
1 Flooded Strand (maintain spell/land ratio)

I’m still not really sure what I think of this round.  Playing around a RIP in play made for some
really interesting situations where I had to be really careful allowing cards to go to the yard, where
normally Doomsday allows us to get around that.  I feel like I probably left something on the table here,
especially in Game 2 where I decided to wait a turn to combo.  Either way, cool to see RIP/Helm making it happen.

### Round 3: Sneak and Show (0-2)  
[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr7YKRJiLqI&index=3&list=PLPsGulnfHUXndjdzkvIZH6ChbyUlEwkdX)

Game 1: I see his Ugin avatar and put him on storm for some reason.  I lose the roll, keep
a mana-tastic hand, and hope for the best. My opponent fetches for an Island, plays a Ponder and 
passes.  I hesitate for a moment on what that means, and opt for a conservative opener to avoid
raising too much suspicion (I notice I’m doing this a lot, maybe I should be opening faster). 
Turn 2 he drops a City of Traitors and a Lotus Petal in play and passes, clearly putting him on
a Show and Tell deck.  I try to brainstorm looking for either my combo (to kill him) or discard 
(to keep him from killing me) and find a bunch of mana.  I therapy a Sneak Attack and pass. I keep 
drawing mana and he eventually kills me super dead.

Game 2:  I keep a landsy hand with Probe/Therapy (which I have a hard time resisting).  I see
a hand with a bunch of protection (including a Surgical, ugh) and therapy away his Brainstorm
to hopefully delay my seemingly inevitable combo death.  My hand never really goes anywhere
and I die to the classic Tin Fins Griselbrand/Emrakul hasty (sneak) attack. 

In:  
2 Echoing Truth  
1 Chain of Vapor (Both of these to put monsters or Omni back in his hand if possible)  
Out:  
3 Conjurer’s Bauble (feels slow in this matchup--I didn’t want to lose mana or discard, so this
seemed like the easiest pick?)

So this is the exact matchup I’m terrified to face with Doomsday.  They are packing plenty of
permission to stop my early combo, while also powering out their own extremely powerful,  fast combo.
I think my keeps were suspect here, which didn’t do me favors in what already feels like an iffy matchup.

### Round 4: Turbo Depths (1-2)  
[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUCQi-pDdcQ&list=PLPsGulnfHUXndjdzkvIZH6ChbyUlEwkdX&index=4)

Game 1: I screw up (in the video) and say it’s Round 3.  Foolish me.  My opponent Thoughtseizes me
off of a Bayou, and I put him on Depths.  Scared of more discard, I GO FOR IT and make a pass the turn
pile planning to Brainstorm a Lab Man back into my pile.  After a lot of hemming and hawing about what
happens if my opponent has more hand disruption, I go for the pile and end up killing him turn 2. 

Game 2: I keep a slow hand that gets jammed up by a turn 2 Sphere of Resistance.  He assembles the 
combo and I scoop maybe too early (with 8:31 left on my clock) to make sure I have time to try to pull out 
game 3.

Game 3: I mulligan to 6, keeping a hand with an Abrupt Decay to deal with the inevitable Sphere effect.
He turn 1's the Sphere and passes.  I’m maybe too aggressive fetching my Tropical Island (telegraphing the Decay).
I fire the decay off in response to a Thoughtseize in an attempt to flex and bust out.  I draw a bunch of
mana and he gets the combo together.

In:  
2 Abrupt Decay (For Sphere of Resistance)  
2 Echoing Truth (Sphere + Marit Lage)  
1 Chain of Vapor (20/20 Removal service)  
1 Tropical Island  
Out:  
1 Rain of Filth (I’ve been meh on this card lately)  
3 Cabal Therapy (lots of non-targets, hard to know what to name, but maybe this was incorrect)  
1 Conjurer’s Bauble (Seems slow, like usual.  Really don’t want redundant copies)  
1 Flooded Strand  

### Round 5: Grixis Delver (0-2)
[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WCqYaZTtVw&list=PLPsGulnfHUXndjdzkvIZH6ChbyUlEwkdX&index=5)

Game 1:  I lose the die roll, and keep what I think is probably a pretty solid hand.  I draw a Petal 
for Turn 1 and decide to Duress/Therapy my Opponent, taking a Force of Will and Brainstorm to try and
slow my opponent down (I think maybe I should have Duressed the Brainstorm and Therapy-ed the Pyromancer?).
He wastes my underground sea and passes.  He gets 2 Pyromancers in play and that gets out of hand before
I’m able to get my combo together.

Game 2: At 1-3, down a game, I decide to keep a hand that, on a crazy Brainstorm gamble, could have killed
on Turn 1. I miss on the Brainstorm and he delves my secrets.

In:  
2 Echoing Truth (For Pyromancer Tokens)  
Out:   
2 Baubles (slow like I’ve been saying)  

## Post League Thoughts

Going 1-4 doesn’t feel great, but in a way, I’d be disappointed if Doomsday was just easy and winning
with it was effortless?  I’m excited that there’s a ton of room to grow.

### What went well?
I won a match!  Obviously going 1 for 5 isn’t ideal, but it’s a lot better than 0 for 5.  
I did my first ever Brainstorm Pile!  I’m pretty sure my G1 pile vs Turbo Depths in Round 4
counts, anyway.  I was worried before the league that I would miss opportunities to do these,
but I was able to make one work.  
I was building piles as I went (with a basic understanding of the fundamentals).  I felt like
I was able to problem solve in their construction a little bit (using Cabal Therapy on myself to
discard Act on Impulse so I could Doomsday it into my pile, Conjurer’s Bauble in case my Turbo 
Depths opponent took the Laboratory Maniac out of my hand), and didn’t feel any real need to look up
the “answers” on the pile document.  That being said, there’s a ton of room to better understand
the tricks here, especially with things like Brainstorm, Conjurer’s Bauble, 
[Double Doomsday](http://ddft.wiki/pages-output/ch2/double-doomsday), etc.  

### What needs work?
Yes, yes, win the other 4 games, next time.  
My understanding of a lot of subtleties of the deck. A few that come to mind:
- Cantrips: when do we use them, when do we hold them?
- Mulligans: how to gauge if a hand is good enough
- Sideboarding: I feel like I have maybe a slight grasp on this, but I want to examine it more closely
- Actually using Tendrils.  (I finally understood after these games that double-Doomsday piles allow
for Pass the Turn piles that kill with Tendrils.  So that’s something to think about)
- Understanding the matchups.  A lot of these felt rough, but I think that understanding Doomsday’s
role in different matchups will make up some of that lost ground in terms of speed.
- Clock management--I got close, especially in the first round, to clocking myself out of a 
few matches.  As primarily a fast combo enthusiast, I’m also just generally not a huge fan of 
going to time every round if I can avoid it.
- I will say that my one fear, as a recovering Belcher/Tin Fins enthusiast, is that the meta 
feels light on countermagic, and heavy on discard and permanent-based hate.  In that world, 
I’m a little uncomfortable running a combo deck that isn’t all-in on using speed as a form of protection.

### Going forwards

I’m not sure where the next Episode of DDFTL;DR will take us.  Clearly, there’s a lot of ground to cover.
Let me know what topics you’d like to see discussed via the Doomsday Discord server, Facebook group or on the 
Stormboards/TheSource forums, and we’ll keep on learning Doomsday together!

TL;DR:  Doomsday is hard.
